<p>  Welcome to the Saga RO2 server software. As some of you might know, Gravity is releasing a sequel to Ragnarok Online and just like it happened with the first part of the game, people will try to recreate the server software that is used to run the official game. But we -and many like us- believe that paying monthly fee's to play a game online is not the way to go. And by creating server software people can join privately organised servers so that you can enjoy the game without being pressed by the bills coming in every month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are going to take a really open approach doing this, so more people can benefit from our work. Our team consists of volunteers that are willing to spend many hours a day to figure out what data is going back and forth and deciphering what its for. We are always looking for capable people to lend us a hand, so if you think you could contribute to our cause, please contact us on the forum or contact us directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saga will be open source, but only after Ragnarok Online 2 goes retail. This is due to vital information Gravity might be able to act upon, and with that, create even more work for us then we already have. Please be patient and look forward to our release.</p>
